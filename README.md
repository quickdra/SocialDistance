Algorithm 7 and 8 are yet to be implemented.

Store.java - contains all the algorithms realted to store - algorithm 1, 3 and 4.

DataBase.java - sets up and declares the tables - Store and StoreStaff.

StoreStaff.java - Contains algorithms related to the store staff - algorithm 2.

Customer.java - Contains algorithms related to customers - aglorithm 5 and 6.

GlobalConstants.java - As the name suggest it's an interface that has PplPerM2, MaxTimeInStore, MaxWindow - global constants.

Note - QRCode is an image that can encodes strings, hence instead of images the strings that are encoded are stored in the database.
and the String can be converted to the image whenever required locally.
